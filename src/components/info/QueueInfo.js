        <h3>Important Point About Arrays</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrays typically begin with 0 as the first index.</li>
          <li>Different languages have different implementations of arrays.  As an example
            Java requires defining the length of an array and that length cannot be changed.  
            This is not the case with JavaScript where array length may change.
          </li>
          <li>Arrays can be used to implement other data structures like linked-lists, stacks, and 
            queues.
